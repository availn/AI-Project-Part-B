Marks:

    4 - quality of code and comments (comments.txt? ask lida)
    4 - correctness and reliability (detecting and not making illegal moves)
    7 - results of testing
    7 - "creativity of solution"
	
Structure of Solution

    Packages and all that

Discussion of our Agent

	- approach to opening (when to transition)
	- approach to midgame (approximate search)
	- approach to endgame (heuristic playouts)

Our Agent's Data Structures

    - Data Structures
        - EdgeSet making initial decisions take constant time to save on time
        - FeatureSet massively reduces branching factor by collecting equivalent moves towards the end of the game

Our Other Agents

    - AgentMe
    - AgentRandom
    - AgentGreedy
    - DoubleAgent

    which all really influenced the final design of AgentFarrugiulian

Other Creative Aspects: The Hexifence Visualisation Engine

    - Using LibGDX to render the board, also using a specialised Referee and specialised interfaces for Players and Boards so that I guess anyone could plug their solution into the visualiser
    
Other Creative Aspects: Possible Extensions and Research and stuff

    - Monte Carlo and Nims and stuff like that
    
    - Endgame Search more and stuff like that
    
    - Transposition table and Lexicographic Pruning (even though the latter of which turns out to be a dud!)

Fun times:

    Skype discussions and screenshots and paper and stuff (46 + 5 + 59 + 39 mins so far, plus 57 + 2:53, plus 1:28 + 1:27 + 11 + 3:34 + 46, plus 1:52 + 14 + ...)

    'after we finished talking about 4-loops, julian was struggling with for-loops'

    Independently both accidentally completing the midgame search function on the same morning.
